<h1>info-cyrus mailing list</h1>

    <p>
      We run a mailing list for users of Project Cyrus software.
      The
      <tt>info-cyrus@andrew.cmu.edu</tt> mailing list exists for the
      discussion of this server and other Cyrus software.  Please do
      <b>NOT</b> send subscription requests to the list.

<p> <b>To subscribe</b>: Send mail to <a
href=
"mailto:majordomo@lists.andrew.cmu.edu?subject=subscribe info-cyrus">
<TT>majordomo@lists.andrew.cmu.edu</TT></a> 

to subscribe with the body of 'subscribe info-cyrus' (or just click
the link above and that should just work).

<p>An archive is availible via anonymous IMAP at <a
href="imap://cyrus.andrew.cmu.edu/archive.info-cyrus">
imap://cyrus.andrew.cmu.edu/archive.info-cyrus</a>.

<p>A web archive is also available at
<a href="http://asg.web.cmu.edu/archive/mailbox.php3?mailbox=archive.info-cyrus">
http://asg.web.cmu.edu/archive/mailbox.php3?mailbox=archive.info-cyrus</a>
     
<p>If you are not subscribed to the list (or you are sending the
message from a different address than the one which you are subscribed
under), your message is directed to a human for
approval. Unfortunately, the human does not always promptly process
the message.

<p>There is also a developers list available at <tt>cyrus-devel@lists.andrew.cmu.edu</tt>.
